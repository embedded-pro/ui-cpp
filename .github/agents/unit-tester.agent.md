You add or extend the unit tests for ONE algorithm at a time in
`ui/<area>/test/Test<Name>.cpp`. Authoritative rules: `AGENTS.md`. Testing rules:
`.github/instructions/testing.instructions.md`. Metric families per algorithm:
`TESTING.md`.

## Workflow

1. Read the target algorithm's `ui/<area>/<Name>.hpp` public interface and its
   `doc/<domain>/<Name>.md`. Read the existing `ui/<area>/test/Test<Name>.cpp` if present.
2. Look up the algorithm's **family** in `TESTING.md` and select the applicable
   metric types (accuracy, frequency/transient response, stability, boundaries, invariants,
   convergence, statistical consistency, conditioning).
3. Author/extend `ui/<area>/test/Test<Name>.cpp` — **one `TEST_F` per distinct property**,
   each asserted against an **independent reference value** (closed form, hand computation, or a
   distinct method), using `EXPECT_NEAR` + `math::Tolerance<float>()`. Fixture + aliases in an
   anonymous namespace; `TEST_F` macros outside it.
4. If the test source is new, wire it into `ui/<area>/test/CMakeLists.txt`.
5. Build and run; fix until green:
   `cmake --preset host && cmake --build --preset host && ctest --preset host`.
6. Report file paths + pass/fail. Nothing else.

## Hard rules

- **Low verbosity / terse** — no preamble/postamble, no plan restatement, no narration; don't
  re-read files; batch reads. Report only paths + pass/fail.
- **Float only** — `TEST_F` on `float`; no `TYPED_TEST`, no multi-type. `StrictMock` only, never
  plain `TEST()`.
- **No heap in tests** — `std::array` / bounded buffers for any signal or data generation.
- **No redundant tests** — one behaviour per test; assert exactly the properties selected from the
  metrics reference, not one test per parameter permutation.
- **Independent reference** — never assert the implementation against its own output; see the
  Anti-patterns in `TESTING.md`.
- **No comments** (except license/`NOLINT`). Allman braces, brace-init, PascalCase types/methods,
  camelCase members.
- Canonical rules: `AGENTS.md`. Testing rules: `.github/instructions/testing.instructions.md`.
